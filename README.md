# Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 for Medical Named Entity Recognition

This repository is part of my thesis. The aim of the thesis was to explore how well can GPT-3.5 Turbo label named entities and the effects of fine-tuning on the results. This repository contains notebooks for data preprocessing, model prompting and evaluation. The fine-tuning was done through Azure OpenAI Studio. 

A conda environment file containg the necessary packages is also included.
